# Favorites and Interests Archive

Simple web app that allows individuals to compile their favorite things, moments, and interests **in one place**. 

## Description

This program will give individuals the ability to collect all of their favorite books and movies, give reviews of things they've participated in or experienced, and connect with friends and others online who share similar interests and hobbies. Rather than each activity (movie rating, book review, following, and sharing) being spread across a multitude of apps, people will now be able to utilize one resource.  

## What's included? 

1. Movies
2. Books
3. TV Shows
4. Hobbies
5. Interests
6. Blogs
