    <h1>My First Code!</h1>
    <h3>(and I'm feeling nervous)</h3>
    <h4>Here are some things I'm excited about: </h4>
    <ol>1. Practicing something that scares me </ol>
    <ol>2. Taking what I learn in class and applying it at work</ol>
    <ol>3. Bragging that I know how to code (kind of)</ol>

<h3><em><strong>"And now that you don't have to be perfect, you can be good."</strong></em></h3> <h4>-John Steinbeck</h4>
